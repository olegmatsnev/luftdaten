This is a script that stores output from a fine dust sensor into a remote MySQL database.

To start using it, one has to populate it with a link to the output in *.json format and database credentials.

To run with a task scheduler on Windows, change the extension to *.pyw -- this will prevent a console window from popping up every time the script runs.
